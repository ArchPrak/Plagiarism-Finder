This progress has impacted immensely in detecting suspicious/abnormal activity such as robbery, vandalism, stempedes, road rage, and so on. For the purpose of this study, transfer learning is employed because of it proven efficiency to train on a small dataset yet producing a promising output. Transfer learning is utilized to train the dataset using Visual Geometry Group network 19 (VGGNet-19) and Visual Geometry Group network 16 (VGGNet-16) pre-trained network to extract the human motion features from a RGB video data. The designed model is employed on two dataset, UMN(University of Minnesota) and WEB crowd dataset to achieve the objective. Analysing the experimental results, VGGNet-19 has been demonstrated a good quality performance of approximately 98% on UMN data while VGGNet-16 has produced a approximately 58% on WEB dataset.\n",
